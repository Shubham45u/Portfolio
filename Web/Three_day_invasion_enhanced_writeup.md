## Approach
This was an OSINT-style challenge involving a satellite image. The task was to trace the image's origin and identify who initially shared it online. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution process:

1. **Image Analysis**  
   The given image appeared to be a satellite photo, possibly taken from a news or social media post. As no metadata was directly available, reverse image searching was the best starting point.

2. **Reverse Image Search**  
   I uploaded the image to **Google Reverse Image Search**. This technique helps identify visually similar images and their sources.

3. **Source Discovery**  
   Google search results revealed a match on **Twitter (X)**, linking to a post that featured the exact same image.

4. **Extracting the Username**  
   By visiting the linked Twitter post, I found the username of the person who originally shared the image.

**Flag:** `flag{jembobineuse}`
